Blood’s everywhere. In the middle of the snowfield lay a young man in black suit with long dark hair and widely open blue eyes. Ha gasped, blood came out from his mouth, his face, his wounds, …everywhere! He seemed powerless to stand up, though he’d tried. Blood dyed the snow into a perfect pure red. White, red and black mixed together, looking to harmonious and beautiful as a lacquer painting. The painting of death…<br><br><i>I feel warm… so warm… but it’s supposed to be cold… Or this is the death?

His eyes blinked continuously.<br><br>“What? When? Why did I have such… a strange dream?” Touya Akira asked himself in silence.<br><br><b>End prologue.</b><br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A/N: Well, what a short part. But it’s just started, right? Here's some explanation you might need:<br><br><u>The dying one:</u> Of course he is Kanda Yuu - the exorcist, one of the main characters in D.Gray-Man. Some information about Kanda you might wanna know (from Wikipedia): He is an 18 year old Exorcist from Japan. He can recover much faster than ordinary humans due to a mysterious tattoo above his heart. It is related to a lotus flower, sealed in an hourglass, that is connected to Kanda's life. It is said that when it wilts, he will die. His purpose in life is to find a person that he refers to as "that someone"; which will be hard but until then, he will never allow himself to die. Kanda has long black hair, which the mangaka noted that he uses soap to wash. However, he has a harsh tongue, foul mouth and a cold manner, and tends to say "Ch" a lot. (And in my oponion, his face quite looks like Touya Akira, though his hair's longer, this inspired me to write this fic.)<br><br><u>Akuma:</u> As I explained, akumas are killing machines that use soul as energy. Exorcists are supposed to destroy akumas.<br><br><u>Bean sprout:</u> Well, "bean sprout" is how Kanda calls Allen Walker, the main char of D. Gray-Man. He's also an exorcist. (In fact, except the hair, he quite looks like Hikaru, that's why I really like to compare the relationship between Hikaru and Akira to the one between Allen and Kanda, but they're not really the same.)<br><br><u>Lavi:</u> An exorcist.<br><br><u>Lenalee:</u> A female exorcist.<br><br>Komui: The supervisor of the Black Order - The Order of Exorcists.<br><br>And another thing, D.Gray-Man mentions a lot about God, Christian, believers,..., however, I don't really know much about them, so forgive me if I make any mistake, okay?
