<br><br><b>Summary:</b> Romeo's thoughts as he watched Mercutio died.<br>French version.<br><br><br><div align="center">
<br><b>I.</b><br><br>Romeo turned around, and watched as Mercutio fell down.<br><br>He hadn’t understood the Capulets’ laugh at first, but then, Tybalt threw something at his feet. It was Romeo’s dagger, stained with blood. Romeo turned around in horror.<br><br>He turned around, and watched as Mercutio fell down, crimson stain on his blue shirt.<br><br><br><b>II.</b><br><br>The Montagues’ anguish cries filled the street, but Romeo heard none of it.

No law, no peace between the families, no beloved Juliet, nor her dear cousin, who was now also his cousin. Nothing, except for the urge to do <i>something</i>, and then, may be, may be, he could finally be freed from this agony. So he picked up the nearest weapon <i>(his dagger, the one with Mercutio’s blood on it)</i> and lauched.<br>
