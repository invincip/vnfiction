Baby blue 5mg pieces of nothingness, they kept dropping and dropping into between his pale lips, and he kept drifting further and further away from the hard cold tiled wall of the fluorescent white bathroom. Ryan always said, to sleep off cocaine, Valium was the perfect remedy.<br><br>He didn’t know one could down this much amount of alcohol without forgetting his own name. Typical Black Label and Jack Daniels, he had never thought his life could be so full of clichés. The vodka scorched even his brain, and a constant thrumming through his head was already forming at the back of the nausea. Ryan always said he preferred cognac because it tasted more like fuel.<br><br>One thing he did know, that was one could die on a mix of Valium and vodka. Any kind of drug, even the lightest kind of sleeping drug, could overdose you into sweet black afterlife with the appropriate amount of liquidfire. Ryan always said that. Ryan tried it once. Ryan overdosed into a sweet four-week hospital stay with tubes sticking out of his arms, his mouth, and his bladder. Ryan got a get-well card that said, “Congratulations on graduating Fuck-Up 101.” It was from one of his anorexic female friends who had overdosed ten times over the course of two months.<br><br>By the time he remembered this, he had downed roughly around sixty baby blue tablets, and three fourth of the vodka bottle. By the time he remembered this, all he could see was white, white, and more white.<br><br>By this time, he remembered one more thing. Ryan was on speed dial of his cellphone. And he pressed ‘call’.<br><br>The phone rang. And rang. And rang for one more time. And it kept ringing.<br><br>Ryan always picked up his phone on the thirteenth ring. Superstitious bitch he could be sometimes. Most people gave up on the sixth ring. Good thing he wasn’t most people.<br><br>“Ross Suicide Hotline. How can I help you?”<br><br>Good thing that people who were desperate enough to call a suicide hotline, they had enough time on their hands to wait until the thirteenth ring.<br><br>To work at a suicide hotline, you had to know the difference between an overdose on cocaine and an overdose on Vicodin plus Jack Daniels. To work at a suicide hotline, you had to try it at least once. Killing yourself, I mean. Also, you had to know when to tell people, “Do yourself a favour and die.”<br><br>“Oh hey, dude, is that you, Bren? What’s your colour of choice today?”<br><br>Baby blue was the colour of choice for his memorial quilt, he said. Slurred. It was anyone’s guess if Ryan could hear anything on the other end.<br><br>“Nice, how many?”<br><br>Baby blue meant Valium. White meant Vicodin. Pink meant X. Crystal meant… crystal. It was just the way blue meant anal, yellow meant watersports, brown meant scat, and red meant bloodplay. They got confused sometimes, but his calling at this time of the night more than often meant drugs.<br><br>He told Ryan the answer.<br><br>“Well, shit. Ambulance?”<br><br>It would be a DOA, he said. Goodbye, he said. Have a good life, he said. See you later, he said. Tell me I’m doing myself a favour and wish me good luck. Ryan tried to say something, but he cut the other off with more slurring and sobbing – Get cleaned. Go to rehab. Start a new life. Don’t die like me. Tell me you’ll remember me.<br><br>“Jesus, are you crying?”<br><br>He didn’t know he had been sobbing until he heard Ryan amidst all the wailing. He didn’t even know what he had been blabbering.<br><br>“Dude, Bren, at the very least you could OD on Vicodin or Xanax! I mean, Valium! That’s so cheap, man! And so goddamn girly. And Valium on vodka is a terrible mix. How could you swallow that?! Dude, if you go out on your first OD, go out with a bang, man!”<br><br>He refrained from quoting T.S. Eliot, but it was true now more than ever that the world was going out with a whimper from his Valium blue lips, and not with a bang. Unless Ryan banged into his apartment right this moment and whisked him to the hospital, which Ryan wouldn’t.<br><br>Ryan was saying all this, and he could tell Ryan was panicking. He told Ryan, dude, you’d come over last Sunday and downed my five fucking grands of goods, all I got left was this bottle of Valium. And blue was a good colour. Now shut up and let me say my last melodramatic speech. This was my death here.<br><br>“Fuck, Bren. Don’t… Just… Look, let me call the ambulance.”<br><br>He knew Ryan wasn’t going to call anyone. Ryan wasn’t that cruel. He told Ryan, see you in a few months. As if he was going on a summer vacation, a Greek holiday with sunshine and blue skies. Miss me. Remember to pick me up at the airport later. Goodbye.<br><br>And he dropped the phone.<br><br>The last thing he heard from the phone speaker, or he thought he heard, was –<br><br>“…Congratulations, sweetheart.”<br><br>And the line went dead.<br><br><br><br>When he woke up at the hospital later with tubes sticking out of his arms, mouth, and bladder, Ryan dropped in to visit, his own arms red and prickling blood from ripping out similar tubes just a short while ago. He knew because the blood looked fresh. Ryan brought him a get-well card that actually said “Get well soon” in printed letters, so he knew Ryan bought it from the hospital gift shop five minutes earlier.<br><br>Thanks for picking me up, he said. Or tried to say.<br><br>Ryan opened his mouth to say something, but the ringing of his cellphone cut him off. It kept ringing, and ringing, and ringing. Ryan picked it up on the thirteenth ring.<br><br>“Ross Suicide Hotline. How can I help you?”<br><br>He could hear distant sobbing, lying here on this death bed. Not a muscle on his face changing, Ryan shut off his phone after roughly one minute. He raised an eyebrow, and Ryan shrugged.<br><br>“That was Mike. Remember the glass-eyed Ativan kid?”<br><br>He coming in here?<br><br>“Nah, going straight to the morgue.”<br><br>---
