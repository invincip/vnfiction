You can read the Vietnamese version here. It's not a translation, though, but rather a second attempt to write. My Eng is not good, but somehow I thought the first Eng version has its own strenghts<br><br>http://vnfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=744<br><br><b>Title: </b>Storytellers<br><br><b>Author</b>: Nguyen Duong Quynh Anh.<br><br><b>Category</b>: Fantasy.

<br></i><br><br><br><br><br>It was 4.00 PM, September 5, 2007.<br><br>Why do we begin this story on such a crowded bus? Was there anything<br>strange?<br><br>No, there was nothing but an old, pure spirit, or we should name it a fairy.<br>There are many fairies in this world. And this one, the one standing besides<br>us on the crowded bus, is one of the most popular one<br><br>Her name is Storyteller. She has been traveling around the world to collect<br>good tales. Then she would tell it to someone who needs it, in order to be<br>paid another story.<br><br>She has been in our world for so long. In most cases, however, we never<br>realize her presence. Only children, whose eyes are clear enough, can hear<br>her gentle voice, see her peaceful faces, and most of all, listen to sweet<br>sweet stories she made for human beings.<br><br><br><br><br>Storyteller did not need a seat. She just stood here, thinking that no one<br>could see her, trying to hear stories of human world.<br><br>Strange as it was, a student sitting near the window suddenly looked up and<br>saw her, the Storyteller, the fairy of tales.

A normal world map that we can buy easily at any<br>bookshop. However, in their eyes, it was the colorful map of childhood<br>dreams…<br><br>They were absorbed in the map without knowing that Storyteller was<br>listening. A childlike smile appeared on her face when she noticed<br>happiness glowed in their eyes.<br><br>At the same time, a schoolgirl sat silently besides them. Closing her eyes,<br>she, too, listened to each word of this story. A bottle of water was put before<br>her. A poisoned bottle of water.<br><br>The bus stopped. All of them, three people and a fairy got up. After Minh<br>went away, the school girl suddenly threw her bottle into a recycle bin.<br><br>The sun was falling.<br><br><i>It’s was too beautiful a sunset to commit suicide.</i><br><br>Storyteller looked straight into the red sunset, suddenly said with a gentle<br>voice. The voice of fairies:<br><br>_Such a nice story, isn’t it? The bird of Sun?
