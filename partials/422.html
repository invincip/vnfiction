<b><i>Stone Angel</i></b><br><br><br>The sunlight diminished slowly<br>painting the sky with fiery hues<br>of scarlet and orange.<br><br>It stood, observing<br>the day ending in melancholy.<br>Eyes heavenward, those empty orbs<br>were marbled white. <br>A forlorn expression carved, <br>upon the face of a child’s.<br><br>Its arms and legs<br>cracked and chipped of paint.<br>And within those tiny palms,<br>an unlit lamp held motionless.<br>Those delicate wings,<br>intricate and outstretched<br>as if ready to fly.<br><br>It was a homeless orphan<br>with no home,<br>like an angel<br>abandoned from heaven.<br><br>The passersby paid no heed<br>or bewildered glances<br>to the lonely form.<br>As it stood there day by day,<br>it shriveled in more agony,<br>and longing.<br><br><br>I want to be free, <br>to be notice, or rather<br>comfortable.<br><br>I need to get away,<br>to that place I know<br>too well, yet<br>I can never seem to get there.<br><br>It’s no virtual reality,<br>no fantasy, or<br>delusion of the mind.<br><br>I’m displaced, misplaced,<br>forced to accept the passing days.<br>And every time I look <br>at the sky, I reach out<br>attempting to touch.<br><br>I watch those clouds<br>and sun fading<br>below that horizon,<br>and pitied the angel,<br>like sympathizing<br>myself.</div>
