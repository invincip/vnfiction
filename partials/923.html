<br><br><br><span style="color:#b3b1b3"><i>I remember that day<br>The day I saw her<br>The crying angle…</i></span><br>  It’s a raining day, I have to run, and I’m late. My sister will kill me if I go home late, it’s a deal of us. Today I have to help her some things. I run through the grassland. I feel cold, my body is wet. Suddenly, I stop when I see some things. A girl with black, long hair. She has two white wings on her back. She wears a white dress. She stands in the rain, and crying. I walk slowly to her. <br><br>-	Hey you!- I talk.<br><br>-	…- She doesn’t answer, she look at me.<br><br>-	Why are you crying?- I ask her.<br><br>-	…- She doesn’t say anything. <br><br>-	…, Ok let go to my house, You will be sick if you stand in the rain!<br><br>-	…- She nods her head in agreement.<br><br>-	Let’s go.- I push her.<br><br>  Ring the house bell, no answer. I open the door, no one here. I see a letter on the table, I come and read it. “Sorry John, today I have a party so I will go home late. May be I will help you tomorrow.” Sign…, she always likes that, I take a look on the arm chair in the living room. The girl with white wings is sitting on it. I smile, I go to the second floor. After five minutes. I go down with a towel and white shirt and pant. I give them to her.<br><br>-	Take this, on the second floor, the right room have a bath room you can take a shower and dress up.- I talk to her.<br><br>She looks at me then go up to the second floor. After a few minute she goes down with the new dress, she gives back  to me the shirt and pant. I look at the white dress that she wears, I could not understand where she get the dress from but never mind. She sits on the chair on my left. I look at her and ask:<br><br>-	Can you talk?<br><br>-	…- She nods her head.<br><br>-	Who are you?- I ask.<br><br>-	I’m... an… ang..el… but…i…can’t…fly…- she talks difficultly.<br><br>-	…<br><br>-	…so…I…can’t… fly to…the…he…aven…- She continues.<br><br>-	That why you cry?<br><br>-	…- she nods her head.<br><br>-	I saw you have wings, why don’t you use it to fly.<br><br>-	…i…can’t use…it, …it’s…wet…- She says.<br><br>-	Ok, I will help you but you have to wait, we will find how to make your wings dry quickly.<br><br>-	…- She nods her head again.<br><br>   After one hour i can make her wings dry. Outside the rain is already stop.<br><br>-	Now you can fly, right?<br><br>-	…But… how to…fly?- She ask, I feel really shock!<br><br>-	I think you have to know how to fly, don’t you?<br><br>-	…<br><br>-	How can I teach you, I don’t know too!- I say and I can see that her face is worry. Then some thing flash in my head.- A! I know how to teach you now, go with me!<br><br>  I take her to the park, I let her sit on the bench, then I go to buy some bread. After that, I break the bread into pieces and put them on the ground and wait for a while.  Then a bird comes to us, and I put more pieces of bread on the ground and more birds come to us.<br><br>-	Do you see how do they use their wings to fly? You just do the same with your wings.- I point to the flying bird.<br><br>-	uh…let me try…- She says and moves her wings.<br><br>  Then her wings begin to move then she can take off and fly.<br><br>-	See! Now you can go to the heaven!- I say.<br><br>-	Uh! Thank you!- She smiles, just like a flower blossoms in the morning and flies away.<br><br>Then I go home, alone. I feel happy, but don’t know why. Today is not too bad. When I go home my sister was already there she asks me where did I go and why do I go home too late. In the dinner I tell her about the angel story but she just calls me crazy. <br><br><span style="color:#b3b1b3"><i>No one believes  in me<br>They all think me crazy<br>Only  the girl and I  know <br>I don’t need anybody to believe<br><br><div align="right">The last time I met you<br>That when I was over forty<br>In that time I looked older than before<br>But you didn’t, you was  just like that<br>Young and beautiful<br>This story I wrote and gave you<br>Because I knew we will never meet again<br>Or may be yes<br>Because I will go to the heaven<br>I wish I can meet you</div></i></span><br>[END]              For the last time I saw you...<div align="center">Fly</div><i>I remember that day<br>The day I saw her<br>The crying angle…</i><i>No one believes  in me<br>They all think me crazy<br>Only  the girl and I  know <br>I don’t need anybody to believe<br><br><div align="right">The last time I met you<br>That when I was over forty<br>In that time I looked older than before<br>But you didn’t, you was  just like that<br>Young and beautiful<br>This story I wrote and gave you<br>Because I knew we will never meet again<br>Or may be yes<br>Because I will go to the heaven<br>I wish I can meet you</div></i>
