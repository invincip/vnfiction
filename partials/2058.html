<br><br>Author: Cát Đằng<br>Rating: M<br>Genre(s): Action, Drama, Multichapter, WIP<br>Warning(s): This is a violent story, although I am not sure about it, but I'm thinking whether or not will I put sexual in there too. After all, this story is about the criminal worlds<br><br>Grave Square seemed just as fine and gloomy as every other day. Somewhere over the rusty seesaw in the playground, there were kids who were playing fascinatingly with their rubber guns and fake-blood bullet. Every time a kid aimed and shot right at the heart or the head of the other kid, they would wildly scream and the shot kid would become a sacrifice for the other ones to play on his body. They would use pen and marker to draw all over his body with signs and pictures, and then force him to walk around naked, showing the sketches and words such as “Loser!” or “Weeper!”, in some cases “Losers die!”.<br><br>However, apart from the playground, other parts of Grave Square, or rather around the entire centre, were deadly quiet. No matter what people do, they managed to keep the noises as down as they can. The only creatures that kept squeaking all over the place were those black crows flying around and around on the bluely grey sky. All the old buildings around Grave Square also had the grey-ish color on them, and it seemed the only place that looked the brightest and stood out of the boring town was Mika’s. A bar decorated with neon lights in a mannered way, which drastically stood out of the place despite itself being located in the dark alley. This bar belongs to Mika, a pretty and refined woman who looked as if she was in her thirtieth, and who loved to dress bridal-like.  At that early time in the morning, there were barely any customer apart from the two guys who were sitting there from when the bar just opened. <br><br>	Dave Halligan, the one who sat on the right side and wore a black shirt and baggy jeans started speaking to his fellow:<br><br>- It is a rather peaceful day around here isn’t it?<br><br>The fellow nodded along and continued to sip a bit more whiskey from his glass. Louis Ulliel, so he was named, was wearing a skull-painted T-shirt, a vest full with zippers and silver decorations, and skinny black trousers.  He and Dave both looked at their twentieth, and they were rather amiable, with Louis having a black highlighted blonde hair with blue eyes, and Dave having light brown hair with brown and green eyes. There has been rumors about Dave’s eyes, particularly about its heterochromatic, and some people said that he got that pair of eyes from a relationship between human and beast, or angels. Though it sounded like these stories that you could expect from those cult-follower, the rumors have never been stamped out, as it seemed that Dave enjoyed the stories himself. Once in a drinking night, he said that it is kind of “cool” when people say that he is half human, half angel, or beast. <br><br>- Well, normally around this time, some gun should have been fired and some bodies would have been found.<br><br>Continued Dave, boringly sipping his drink. Louis remained silent, and just nodded. In fact, Louis has never spoken a word since the first time people started to know him. Since then, he is considered mute in everyone’s mind. The two fellows continued drinking their alcohol and chasing their own mind until a gun banged outside of the bar startled them. The sound attracted them two and Mika, the bar’s owner, to look outside the bar’s door curiously. Mika stopped cleaning the glasses, reached her hand to open the counter’s small door to get outside, and sighed at Dave:<br><br>- You see? That is the reason why I never allow you to talk inside my bar. Every single time, Dave. Every single time.<br><br>Mika walked to the door, still muttering:<br><br>- Geez, now I have to go and see the bodies. It is eight in the morning, do you not have any sympathy for me?<br><br>While Dave were talking ill about Mika to Louis, and while Mika were approaching her steps to the bar’s door, a black tall man suddenly walked into the bar, and looked around the furniture. Mika, breathing from the attempt of avoiding the door bang on her, looked at the man. Louis and Dave were also focusing their eyes fixated on the unwelcomed stranger. There were blood all over his body and the gun he is holding in his right hand pointing down the floor, which was clearly the evidence saying that he was the culprit of the gun firing from before. Blood continued dripping down the floor, which made Mika looked down the floor with a quizzical eyebrow as if she would just take a tower and quickly clean the mess up. But that attempt of her was interrupted when the black man with a gun started speaking:<br><br>- Heard this bar’s also a brothel.<br><br>Mika looked up to the man. He was about thirty-one or thirty-two, with a black skin and his hair braided closely to his head. He was wearing a flashy coat with fur and feather decorated on it, and a shiny leather trousers. She tried not to laugh, but his image remind her of one type of bird that has white feathers and black legs. Finished judging his outwear, she finally answered:<br><br>- Not now big boy. Did you not have enough fun out there?<br><br>And as Mika expected, he was definitely not the type of guy who buys her sense of humor. He kept asking:<br><br>- Ya have some gals?<br><br>Not giving up her joking talent, Mika looked down her watch and smiled:<br><br>- Not around this time boy, ya should go back and snuck in ‘cha blanket. The gals are, too. Go back and snug in ’cha blanket, will ya?<br><br>When she opened her eyes again, the bloody gun has been raised to her forehead. The blood has been dried and were then remained on the cold silver metal. The gun let out a “crack” sound as the big black man turned the safe lock. He looked at Mika, impatiently tried to low his voice to the cool tone, which was proven a failure as it turned into something squeaky, said:<br><br>- I said now.<br><br>Back at the counter, Dave and Louis have already stood up and put their hand into their pockets. Mika, still calmly smiled at the man, shouted:<br><br>- No violence in my bar, those two over there!<br><br>Right when she finished her line, a gun banged again, this time much louder than the first time, and sounded like a alarm bell woke everyone in the center off their sleepiness and boredom. Some of the owners near Mika’s started mumbling to each other.<br><br>“ Those new kids never learn not to stand up against Mika.”<br><br>“Well, my dear, they never have enough of a life time to actually start learning about it”<br><br>Back to Mika’s, right after the gun fired, the black man’s body flew out of the door, blood spilled out of his chest where just a minute ago his heart was beating. The body crashed on the wall opposite to the bar’s door, and fell down to the garbage lump right next to the wall. Inside the bar, Mika stood at the door, one hand on the door, and another holding a squared gun, staring at the dead body, also her state of the art. She turned around, shouted at Dave to throw her a towel, and started mopping up the blood on the floor that the deceased black man and his victim spilt. Dave looked curiously at the gun, and asked:<br><br>- Isn’t that the gun of Sharkie? How do you get it?<br><br>- No, it is not. It’s just a replica. I asked Jack to do one for me for, you know, self-defense.- Mika answered, trying harder to mop out the dried blood on the floor.<br><br>- What happened to the Colt 45 of yours? Was that not enough of a self-defense thing?<br><br>- It was, only if it was not broken.<br><br>Dave nodded and looked quizzically at Louis. He mumbled “and broken here means she crashed it into some intruder’s head when she was out of bullet.” Right after that, he quickly raised both his hand over his head to defense himself when Mika walked back to the counter. But she ignored him, and went to the sink to wash the bloody towel. While looking at the short wedding dress that she is wearing and her bridal hairdo, Dave could not resist the temptation to open his mouth again:<br><br>- Oh, and what about the “no violence in my bar” thing?<br><br>Mika squeezed the towel in her hand and shook it open, looking at the mirror on the wall where she could see both Dave and Louis looking curiously at her, sneered:<br><br>- Did you not see where I was standing? The entrance, my boy. The entrance.<br><br>After she has done talking, she ignored Dave’s repeating attempts to annoy her again and walked to the door, took a cellphone out of her bra and started dialing. Louis, finished off his drink, looked at Mika while she was talking. He knew exactly who was on the other line, because he is the one that she would always call after she has finished having fun. Louis did not like that man, though. He thought that some-thing-Smith guy, with a charming outlook, had some kind of a strange and mysterious mist all over him. Anyway, not his business, or he assured himself so, looking at Dave playing with his glasses. <br>At the door, Mika was talking on the phone with the guy that Louis thought about.<br><br>“ Grant? Yeah I got something for you. Just come quick.”<br><br>She played with her hair as if she was a little girl, and looked outside the garbage lump, where the dead body was staring at her frightfully and surprisingly. After a second she decided that it was not anything fun to look at her victim like that, she turned around and walked into the bar, still having her phone on.<br><br>“What are you talking about? Of course it is fresh, my dear”<br><br><b>TBC</b>
